===

This plugin bundles all the components of [Apache HttpComponents Client 4.5.x](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html) except `httpclient-win` because of the dependency on jna.
These components can be used by other plugins as a dependency.
It allows managing library updates independently from plugins.
